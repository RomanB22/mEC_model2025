All the model data used in Figure 3-6 are generated in NEURON software.

The relevant mod files are included in the each folders. The NEURON codes (hoc files) can be directly used after compiling (using terminal or command prompt) the mod files.
Details of NEURON installation and usage can be accessed through: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/ 

However, for running MPMOSS, shell scripts are used for each kind of noise (/OSC_shell_july).
